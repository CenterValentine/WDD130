            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Country Rafting Co. was founded in [Year] by a group of friends driven by their love for adventure and
                the outdoors. Starting with just a few rafts, we quickly grew into a leading provider of thrilling
                rafting experiences.
                Through dedication and a commitment to excellence, we've expanded our fleet, added new routes, and built
                a team of experienced guides who share our passion for the river. Despite challenges, our focus on
                delivering unforgettable adventures has never wavered.
                Today, Country Rafting Co. stands as a symbol of adventure, offering safe and exhilarating rafting
                experiences that connect people with the beauty and power of nature. Join us as we continue to ride the
                rapids and create memories that last a lifetime.
