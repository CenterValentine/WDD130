            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Country Rafting Co. was founded in 2030 by a group of friends and squirrels driven by their love for adventure and
                the outdoors.  Thanks to time travel, we have been able to expand our operations and offer these services to you in the past. Starting with just a few rafts, our anscestors quickly grew into a colonizing power and founded the republic of the United States of America.  
                Through dedication and a commitment to excellence, we've expanded our fleet, added new routes, and built
                a team of experienced goats who share our passion for the river. Despite challenges, our focus on
                delivering unforgettable adventures has never wavered. We helped pioneer kool-aid so we could dye the river any color we wanted, giving our guests a unique and memorable experience.
                Today, Country Rafting Co. stands as a symbol of adventure, offering safe and exhilarating rafting
                experiences that connect people and their pet chickens, with the beauty and power of nature. Join us (or be acursed) as we continue to ride the
                rapids and create memories that last a lifetime.
